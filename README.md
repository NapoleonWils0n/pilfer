## Recording from within Kodi

You need to install the playercorefactory.xml into your Kodi userdata folder,  
and restart Kodi for the menu to show up.

Press y on the keyboard while a video is playing in Kodi to bring up the contextual menu,  
from the menu you can then choose from the following options.

* play
* record video
* record video - 30 minutes
* record video - 1 hour
* record video - 2 hours
* record video - 3 hours
* save url
* record audio
* record audio - 30 minutes
* record audio - 1 hour
* record audio - 2 hours
* record audio - 3 hours

You can also edit the playercorefactory.xml file and add your own menu entrys,  
to create more recording durations.

Video and audio recordings will be saved to the Desktop with current date and time in the filename,  
so that each recording has a unique name and isnt overwritten by another recording

It isnt possible to get the videos title from the url which is why we add the date and time to the filename

The recording will be saved to your Desktop with the following filename

video-{date}-{time}.mkv  
audio-{date}-{time}.mka


## Script usage on the command line

Record video with the -i option with a url in single quotes

* url surrounded by single quotes

```
pilfer -i 'http://example.com/video.m3u8'
```

Record audio with the -a option

* url surrounded by single quotes

```
pilfer -a 'http://example.com/video.m3u8'
```

Record with the -i option and a text file

* Text file containing url

```
pilfer -i url.txt
```

Record audio with the -a option and a text file

* Text file containing url

```
pilfer -a url.txt
```

Recording with duration, 00:00:00 = hours:minutes:seconds

* Record video for 30 minutes

```
pilfer -i 'http://example.com/video.m3u8' -t 00:30:00
```

* Record audio for 30 minutes

```
pilfer -a 'http://example.com/video.m3u8' -t 00:30:00
```

* Record video for 1 hour

```
pilfer -i 'http://example.com/video.m3u8' -t 01:00:00
```

* Record audio for 1 hour

```
pilfer -a 'http://example.com/video.m3u8' -t 01:00:00
```

Text file containing url, recording with duration, 00:00:00 = hours:minutes:seconds

* Record for 30 minutes

```
pilfer -i video-url.txt -t 00:30:00
```

* Record for 1 hour

The pip command may also be called pip3.6 on different linux distribution

The quickest way to find to find the name of the pip command on linux is to type pip in the terminal  
and then press the tab key and it will show you a list of the pip commands.

```
pip3 install --user git+https://github.com/NapoleonWils0n/pilfer.git
```

* Upgrade scripts with pip

```
pip3 install --upgrade --user git+https://github.com/NapoleonWils0n/pilfer.git
```

#### pipx for ubuntu 23.04 and debian

If you are using ubuntu 23.04 or the latest version of debian you need to use pipx to install pilfer

install pipx

```
sudo apt install pipx
```

ensure path

```
pipx ensurepath
```

pilfer install

```
pipx install git+https://github.com/NapoleonWils0n/pilfer.git
```
